# NumPy - Numeric Python


## Instalation

pip3 install numpy

## Basics

Import numpy package:

    import numpy as np
    
Create a numpy array:

    >>> npArray = np.array([1.25, 2.2, 3.5])
    >>> npArray
    array([1.25, 2.2, 3.5])
    
NumPy Arrays are quite different from lists, for example:

    [1,2,3] + [1,2,3]

In Python Lists, we would get: `[1,2,3,1,2,3]`

In NumPy Arrays, we would get: `array([2,4,6])`
