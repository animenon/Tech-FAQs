# RASA Open Source - a conversational AI framework for building contextual assistants

Rasa Open Source includes

- NLU: determines what the user wants and captures key contextual information
- Core: selects the next best response or action based on conversation history
- Channels and integrations: connect assistant to users and backend systems

Rasa X is a toolset that helps you leverage conversations to improve your assistant.

## Commands

Initialize a new rasa project, this setsup a basic chatbot with few default intents and utterences(responses):

    rasa init

It asks for location where project should be created, just click `Enter` to create in the current
 directory or you may specify the new location. `--no-prompt` flag can be used to avoid these.
